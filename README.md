🚀 Project Showcase: Online Medical Appointment Booking System

I’m excited to share my recently completed project — an Online Medical Appointment Booking System, developed as part of my learning journey in C#, .NET, and Web Development.

📌 Tech Stack Used:

Backend: C#, ASP.NET Core MVC

Frontend: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript

Database: SQL Server

Architecture: MVC (Model–View–Controller)

✨ Key Features Implemented:

Patient registration and secure login

Online doctor appointment booking

Department-based doctor selection (Cardiology, Neurology, General Medicine)

Admin dashboard for managing appointments

Appointment approval and rejection system

Email notification on appointment status update

Responsive and user-friendly UI

Integrated Google Maps for location display

Testimonials and service sections for better UX

🎥 I’ve attached a screen-recorded demo showing the complete workflow of the system.

This project helped me strengthen my understanding of backend development, MVC architecture, database integration, and real-world system design. I’m continuously improving and adding new features as I learn more.

I’d really appreciate any feedback or suggestions! 🙌
